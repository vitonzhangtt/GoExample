4. Exit with status 3.

/*
5. Note that unlike e.g. C, Go does not use an integer return 
	value from main to indicate exit status. If youâ€™d like 
	to exit with a non-zero status you should use os.Exit.
*/

/*
6. 
$ go run exit.go

If you run exit.go using go run, the exit will be picked up 
	by go and printed.

/*
7. 
$ go build exit.go
$ ./exit
$ echo $?

By building and executing a binary you can see the status 
	in the terminal.
